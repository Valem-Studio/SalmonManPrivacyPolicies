### **1. Introduction**

**SALMON MAN** is a VR game developed by **Valem Studio** for the Meta Quest platform.  
We respect your privacy and are committed to complying with all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

SALMON MAN is designed as a **primarily offline, single-player experience**. The game does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data directly to Valem Studio **except for minimal information needed to support certain features** (as detailed below).  

However, because the game is distributed through the **Meta Quest platform**, certain data may be processed automatically by **Meta Platforms, Inc.** to enable platform features and ensure proper functionality.

---

### **2. Data Processed Through the Meta Platform**

While Valem Studio does not directly collect or store your Meta account data, **Meta** may process certain information as part of your interaction with the game, including:

- **Meta Account Information** (such as your user ID and profile name) used by Meta to authenticate your ownership of the game on the platform.  
- **Device and System Data** (for example, headset type, performance metrics, and crash reports) automatically handled by Meta for platform stability, performance analytics, and improving their services.  
- **Entitlement Verification** to confirm that your Meta account is authorized to play SALMON MAN (i.e., that you have legitimately acquired the game).

This data is **handled exclusively by Meta** in accordance with [Metaâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/privacy-policy/).  
Valem Studio does **not** have access to this platform-level data and does not use it for analytics, advertising, or tracking purposes.

---

### **3. Data Collected and Used by Valem Studio**

Valem Studio collects and processes **only a minimal amount of personal data** through SALMON MAN, solely to support an optional in-game feature:

- **Leaderboard Data:** If you participate in the gameâ€™s online leaderboard, SALMON MAN will access your basic Meta account identifiers (such as your Oculus user ID and display username) and your game score or performance metrics. This information is used to create a leaderboard entry showing your rank among players. The data (your user ID, username, and score) is transmitted to a secure cloud service to be stored and displayed on the global leaderboard.  

Apart from the above **leaderboard-related data**, **no other personal information** is collected or processed by Valem Studio. We do **not** collect any sensitive personal details, nor do we use any third-party analytics or tracking tools in SALMON MAN. Outside of the leaderboard functionality, the game runs entirely offline and does not send any data to external servers.

---

### **4. Data Usage and Sharing**

Any data collected by SALMON MAN is used **strictly for gameplay features** and is not used for any unrelated purposes. In particular, the leaderboard data is used only to allow you and other players to view rankings within the game:

- Your **user ID and profile name** are used to identify your entry on the leaderboard, and your **score** is used to rank you appropriately among other players.  
- This information is **not used for anything outside of the gameâ€™s leaderboard**. Valem Studio does **not** use it for analytics, advertising, profiling, or any form of marketing.  

To provide the global leaderboard feature, SALMON MAN transmits your leaderboard data to **Unityâ€™s cloud services**, which host and maintain the leaderboard on behalf of Valem Studio. Unity acts as a data processor for this information, meaning it stores and safeguards the data solely to power the leaderboard feature (showing high scores and rankings to players). Unity does **not** use your data for its own purposes, and Valem Studio does not independently access or exploit this data beyond the gameâ€™s functionality.

Aside from the use of Unityâ€™s secure leaderboard service (and Metaâ€™s platform services described in Section 2), **no other third parties** receive your personal data. We do **not** share, sell, or disclose your personal information to any other companies or services.

### **5. Data Retention and Deletion Requests**

**Data Retention:** Leaderboard data that SALMON MAN collects (your user ID, username, and scores) is retained for as long as necessary to support the leaderboard feature. In practice, your leaderboard entry will remain stored on the leaderboard service **for as long as the leaderboard is active and the game is available** to players. We may occasionally reset or clear leaderboard data as part of game updates or maintenance (for example, starting a new season or clearing out old scores), but otherwise your data will remain on the leaderboard until it is removed in accordance with this policy or you request its removal.

**Data Deletion Requests:** If you wish to have your personal data removed from SALMON MANâ€™s leaderboard (for example, if you want your username and score deleted from our records), you have the right to request deletion. To do so, please **contact us** at **[contact@valemstudio.com](mailto:contact@valemstudio.com)** with your request. Provide identifying details (such as the username or account information used in-game) so we can locate your data. We will **promptly delete or anonymize** your leaderboard data from our systems and from Unityâ€™s cloud leaderboard service in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Since Valem Studio does not maintain any other personal data about players, removing your leaderboard information will generally cover all personal data related to your use of SALMON MAN.

For any data that is handled by **Metaâ€™s platform** (as described in Section 2), such as your Meta account or profile information, please use Metaâ€™s own tools to manage or delete that data. You can refer to [Metaâ€™s data management tools](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/privacy-policy/) (available via your Meta account settings) or contact Meta directly to address removal of any information that Meta possesses about you. Valem Studio does not have the ability to delete or modify data on Metaâ€™s systems.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled in SALMON MAN, you can also contact us at **[contact@valemstudio.com](mailto:contact@valemstudio.com)**. We are happy to assist you and will address any privacy-related inquiries promptly.
